| 7.9.9   | Fixed small marketplace bug on trying to sell items<br/>Now "NPC Model Override" can be literally ANYTHING in game: Piece objects (structures), Itemdrops, trees and so on<br/>Please use new model override feature on your own risk since its not being tested yet and may cause a lot of bugs. DO NOT USE VFX's as model override or model will be gone. If you somehow failed NPC model override then write it chat /npc remove . That will cause all near NPC's (5 meter range) be removed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 8.0.0   | 1) Bugfixes<br/>2) Added new Premium System: Distanced UI that can use NPC profiles without interacting with NPCs. To use go to MarketplaceKG/PremiumSystem/ folder to  edit .cfg file. Hotkey to open UI is L. Alt + ~<br/>3) Added new NPC UI : Save/Load. Opens with C + Interact. Allows you to save NPC appearance and then load it back on another NPC. To save ALL NPCs in your location write /npc save in chat<br/>4) Replaced old localization on LocalizationManager. Now you can add your own localization. For that download file: https://pastebin.com/7z08xMQq . Place it into Valheim/BepInEx/config/ folder and name it MarketplaceAndServerNPCs.YOURLANGUAGE.yml . Then you can translate lines to make your own language localization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
